# Calculator Project

Welcome to the Calculator project! This is a simple web-based calculator that allows you to perform basic mathematical operations. 
This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly calculator interface with an index.html file, a style.css file, and an onclick event in JavaScript.


## Project Structure

The project consists of two files:

- index.html: Contains the HTML structure and user interface elements of the calculator.
- style.css: Contains the CSS styles to customize the appearance of the calculator.
## Usage
To use the calculator, open the index.html file in a web browser. You will see a calculator interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and an output display.

- Click on the number buttons to input the desired numbers.
- Click on the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to select the operation you want to perform.
- Click on the equal button (=) to calculate the result.
- Click on the Clear All button (Clear All) to clear the calculator's output.
## Customization
If you wish to customize the calculator's appearance, you can modify the style.css file. Feel free to adjust the colors, fonts, sizes, and other CSS properties to suit your preferences.
## Customizing the Style
To change the visual style of the calculator, open the style.css file. You can modify the colors, font styles, button sizes, or any other CSS properties to suit your preferences.
## Customizing the Functionality
To modify the calculator's functionality, open the index.html file and locate the JavaScript code. 
You will find event handlers for each button's onclick event. You can edit or add JavaScript code within these event handlers to change how the calculator performs calculations or add additional features.
